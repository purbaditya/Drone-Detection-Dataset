# Drone-Detection-Dataset
A pubic drone dataset containing images of drones from different cameras of different resolutions along with the respective annotation files in xml format. The dataset will be extended with color images as well, at a later time. The current dataset is divided into subfolders based on the camera names and the location of the video recording. The corresponding labels are in the *_Pascal_VOC dataset. The dataset can be found here

Hopefully, the dataset and its future extensions can be useful for any work related to drone activity monitoring. Kindly refer to the following paper (to be published) if you are using the dataset
